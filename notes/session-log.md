## 2026-09-21 -- first marimo notebook

Task (per `notes/project.md`): build the first marimo notebook -- one that
loads every syntax analysis file in `data/` automatically, with no user
prompting, and otherwise mimics the behavior of arsgrammatica's own
`marimo/latin_syntaxer_review.py`.

What I did:

- Read `CLAUDE.md` and `notes/project.md` for scope and restrictions.
- Inspected the `.cex` files in `data/` directly, and fetched
  arsgrammatica's serialization-format reference and the actual source of
  `marimo/latin_syntaxer_review.py` from
  https://github.com/neelsmith/arsgrammatica (installed the package with
  `pip install git+https://github.com/neelsmith/arsgrammatica.git` in a
  scratch environment to confirm exact function signatures and behavior
  against the real `data/` files -- not installed anywhere in this repo).
- Wrote `marimo/review_analyses.py`. It follows
  `latin_syntaxer_review.py` cell-for-cell, with one substantive change:
  the `mo.ui.file_browser` is replaced by a loading cell that globs
  `data/*.cex`, sorts them by the numeric `tokenized_<n>` suffix in each
  filename (so sentences stay in reading order regardless of alphabetical
  quirks -- e.g. `_10` sorting before `_2`), and calls `read_analyses()`
  on each file, concatenating `(tokengraph, verbalunits, sentences,
  lm_infos)` across all of them. A file that fails to parse is reported as
  a warning and skipped, rather than blocking the rest. Everything
  downstream (sentence picker, highlighting, Mermaid/Graphviz/displaCy
  diagrams, subordination-depth slider, AAT graph) is unchanged from the
  reference notebook, now just spanning every sentence in `data/` instead
  of one browsed file.
- Validated the notebook two ways before writing it back: (1) ran the
  loading/concatenation logic standalone against the real 17 files in
  `data/` (confirms 17 sentences load in the correct order 1-12, 14-18 --
  file `..._13_...` does not exist -- and that every rendering function
  arsgrammatica exposes runs cleanly on the first sentence); (2)
  `marimo export script` + `marimo export html` on the assembled notebook
  itself, both completing without error.
- Did not modify `README.md`, `releases.md`, `quarto/`, or `docs/`.
- Did not run `git add`/`git commit`/`git push` -- left the new file and
  this log entry unstaged for Neel to review.

Left for a future session: nothing outstanding from `notes/project.md` --
the first notebook is done. Possible next steps if wanted: notebooks for
the other `marimo/latin_syntaxer_*.py` variants (ctsdata, graph metrics,
selected ids, text input, tokenized), or a `pyproject.toml`/requirements
file pinning `arsgrammatica`/`marimo` for this repo specifically (the new
notebook currently only declares them via a PEP 723 `# /// script` header,
which `marimo edit --sandbox` and `uv run` pick up automatically but a
plain `pip install` workflow would not).
